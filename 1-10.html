I never thought I could be in love<br>
I never thought someone's love could make me see<br>
How empty and cold my life can be<br>
Alone here without you<br>

I was content to be on my own<br>
Never knowing that I was all alone<br>
Now I need to hold you <br>
And make you see the way I feel for you<br>

Someone to save me and take these chains away<br>
I'm waiting for someone to love<br>

Here inside my world<br>
I just can't find my way without you <br>
Lost inside myself, alone<br>


I never thought I could need someone<br>
And in a moment you took it all away<br>
And now I'm not knowing what to say<br>
Alone here without you<br>

And ever since I saw your face<br>
My sensibility's lost  without a trace <br>
To think that I can't hold you<br>
Is more than I can take cause I love you<br>

Someone to save me and take these chains away<br>
I'm waiting for someone to love<br>

Here inside my world<br>
I just can't find my way without you<br>
Lost inside myself, alone<br>

Here inside my world<br>
Where the wind won't blow and the sun won't shine<br>
Lost inside myself, alone<br>
